# optiMIPS - Mips-Assemblr
Basic assemblr for MIPS ISA.

Build for Computer Architecture Course in METU NCC by 3 best of the best students you would ever seen (Like anyone would read this part).

It doesn't have all of the MIPS ISA but new instructions can be implemented easly.

Follow comments inside the assemblr.py for adding new instructions.

### Capabilities:

There is two mode batch and interactive.

In interactive mode user can write one line of MIPS code and convert it to hex.

Or in batch mode to convert file full of instructins to hex.

To use batch mode add a file called program.src in the same directory that contains MIPS code and the program.
<pre>
Build in Ubuntu 20.04 at NeoVim.
